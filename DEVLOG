- Client processing of received progress packets
- Implemented send/recv for packet type 5; client/server progress packets
    TRProtocol:
    * Implemented send and recv functions for packet type 5
    
    Client:
    * Sends progress packets with WPM and progress to the server
    
    Server:
    * Receives progress packets, doesn't do much with them yet...

- Added print_packet type 6; Server prints out recieved rstart packet
- Added WPM calculation
    - Uses `struct timespec` to get the start time and the current time
    - Calculates the time difference in milliseconds
    - Calculates the WPM using calculated time difference in minutes
- Fixed accuracy calculation, cleaned up
    - Moved error calculation to when the user types so it doesn't dock errors every time the player backspaces into an incorrectly typed character
    - Moved accuracy calculation to separate line
    - Added comments for typed text printing
- Added waiting for host message for non-hosts
